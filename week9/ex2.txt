The miss ratio is proportional to the number of distinct references occurred.
E.g. for the input 1, 2, 3, 4, ... n - 1, n the Miss Ratio will be 1

Or, it can be thought in another way, if we have page count = N, then the miss ratio
will depend on the average number of distinct references in each N sized subarray of the input array

On the other hand, the hit ratio is proportional to the number of the same references occurred.
Or, similarly to miss ration, it can be thought as average number of pairs of the same references of the input array
